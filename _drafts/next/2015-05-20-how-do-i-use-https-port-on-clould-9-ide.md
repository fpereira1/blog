title: "How do I use HTTPS port on clould9 ide?"

I am just running some tests on [c9.io](http://c9.io) - but I am stuck on how to get the HTTPS server to run.

I am using the port given in `process.env.PORT` which links up to the browser in c9, but there doesn't seem to an HTTPS port. In a local environment I use port 3001 for HTTPS.
