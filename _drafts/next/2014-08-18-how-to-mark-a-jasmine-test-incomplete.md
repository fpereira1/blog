In Jasmine 2.0 I can use `xit` instead of `it` to make jasmine skip the test. [Disabling suites](http://jasmine.github.io/edge/introduction.html#section-Disabling_Suites)

I am likely to forget these tests since they don't appear in the result. So I was hoping to mark these tests as incomplete, this should warn me to look at it at some point.

Is it possible to mark them as disabled/incomplete so that they appear in the results as such?
