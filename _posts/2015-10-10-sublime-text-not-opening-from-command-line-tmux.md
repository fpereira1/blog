I have Sublime Text as an alias so I can call it from the terminal on MacOS.

Since I started using tmux, Running the following command opens sublime but not on the current directory. It's like aliases are not accepting arguments on tmux.

```
subl .

```

Without tmux this command works fine.

Any known issue with tmux alias arguments?
